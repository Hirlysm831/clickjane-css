This is a user style sheet to do what it can to avoid clickjacking.

class of web-based security vulnerabilities similar to phishing
scams. The technique uses web standards to trick unsuspecting

The clickjane.css file is a user style sheet that does its best
to ensure that any possible clickjacking attempts are immediately
visible instead of remaining invisible.
